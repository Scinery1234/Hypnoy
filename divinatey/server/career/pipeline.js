// The Career Reading engine.
//
// prepare() does every calculation (no AI): the quiz scores, the five charts
// (each in its own isolated engine), their 30-day forecasts, and the draw,
// which must have been cast before the question was asked.
//
// buildSteps() turns that into the AI steps. Each step is one fresh prompt
// built from calculated data and the person's own answers, never from text
// another step wrote. Stage C steps see one system only. Stage D steps are
// the explicit cross-system layer and get data from every system.
//
// runSteps() runs them with any runner: the Anthropic API, or a file of
// answers keyed by step id (for offline samples and tests).
