# Divinatey

I Ching + Tarot drawn from this exact moment in time, interpreted by Claude, plus five charts: Gene Keys, Human Design, Western natal, Vedic and Numerology. Built by [Vikashan](https://www.vikashan.org).

## How it works

- **Server** (`server/`, Express): holds the Anthropic API key, generates the seed (timestamp + ANU quantum noise, with hardware entropy as fallback), casts the reading and asks Claude to interpret it.
- **Client** (`src/`, React + Vite): the splash screen, the reading, the follow-up chat, crisis resources, and the About/Terms/Privacy pages (at `/about`, `/terms`, `/privacy`).
- **Shared** (`shared/`): the casting engine used by both sides, the crisis keywords, and the chart engine (`shared/astro/`).
- **Charts** (`server/astro.js`): the server calculates and renders every chart from the birth details, so the free limit can't be bypassed. Each system is loaded into its own isolated instance of the engine. Routes: `GET /api/places?q=` (birth place search over 111k GeoNames places), `GET /api/systems`, `POST /api/chart`. The free tier allows `FREE_CHARTS_PER_DAY` (2) different people per IP per day. One person's birth details open every system and count once; reopening them doesn't count again.

**Numerology** (`shared/astro/systems/numerology.js`, Pythagorean) works from the full name at birth (`birthName`, required, up to 100 characters) and the birth date; the time and place are optional (without a place, "today" for the personal cycles is read in UTC). It shows the core numbers (life path, expression, soul urge, personality, birthday, maturity, and the current name if it differs), the letters of the name, the balance of numbers 1–9 with karmic lessons, hidden passion and karmic debts, the four pinnacles and challenges, and the personal year, month and day with the next 7 days. Master numbers 11, 22 and 33 are kept; Y counts as a vowel when no other vowel is next to it. AI prompts get only the numbers and the birth date, never the birth name. IPs are held only as keyed hashes and reset daily.

The client only ever sends the **seed** back. The server rebuilds the reading from it, so a client can't get arbitrary content into the prompts, and the API key never reaches the browser. The three interpretations (I Ching, Tarot, synthesis) run in parallel and return structured JSON.

Nothing is stored unless someone creates an account (see below). Rate limiting is an in-memory, per-IP counter (`RATE_LIMIT_PER_10MIN`, 40 by default).

## Running locally

Requires Node 22+.

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npm install
npm run dev               # API on :8787, app on http://localhost:5173
```

## Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start                 # serves the app and API on $PORT (8787 by default)
```

Or use Docker:

```bash
docker build -t divinatey .
docker run -p 8787:8787 -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... divinatey
```

If the app runs behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, set `TRUST_PROXY=1` so rate limits apply to the real client IPs. The rate limiter keeps its counts in memory, so if you run several instances, enforce limits at the proxy instead.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | (required) | |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claude-opus-5-5` | |
| `ORACLE_EFFORT` | `low` | `low`–`max`. Higher is slower and costs more. |
| `ANU_API_KEY` | (unset) | Key for ANU's quantum API. Without it, the app tries ANU's legacy endpoint and then falls back to `crypto`. |
| `PORT` | `8787` | |
| `RATE_LIMIT_PER_10MIN` | `40` | Interpret and chat requests per IP |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | (unset) | Set to `1` behind a proxy |
| `FREE_CHARTS_PER_DAY` | `2` | Different people (birth details) each IP may open per UTC day, each in every system |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | (unset) | Turns accounts on, with the two keys below |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | (unset) | Public key the browser uses to sign in |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | (unset) | Secret; server only |
| `FREE_LIMIT_SECRET` | (random per start) | Key for hashing IPs in the free chart count |
| `PAID_PREVIEW` | on | Set to `0` to close the paid preview at `/preview` |
| `PREVIEW_CHAT_PER_10MIN` | `20` | Chat messages per IP in the preview |
| `EXPLAIN_PER_10MIN` | `60` | Chart explanations and reading sections per IP (paid and preview) |
| `ANTHROPIC_QUICK_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-5-5` | Fast model for picking chart facts and polishing linked replies |
| `LINKED_QUESTIONS_PER_WEEK` | `5` | Draws a paid account can ask with linked charts each week |
| `LINKED_TIME_BUDGET_MS` | `25000` | After this long, a linked reply skips the polish step so it finishes before host time limits |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | (unset) | Turns payments on |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | (unset) | Signing secret of the webhook endpoint |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | (request host) | The site's public address, for Stripe's return links |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY` / `_YEARLY` / `_EXTRA` | (lookup keys) | Use specific price IDs instead of the lookup keys |

If a request is declined on policy grounds, it's automatically retried on Anthropic's recommended fallback model (`fallbacks: "default"`).

## Accounts (Supabase)

Accounts are optional: drawing and free charts work without them. With Supabase configured, people can sign up with email and password or use a magic link, reset their password, and (on the paid plan) save two charts.

1. Create a Supabase project and run the files in `supabase/migrations/` in order (0001 to 0004) in the SQL editor. 0004 lets saved charts use Numerology.
2. In **Authentication → URL Configuration**, set the Site URL to your domain and add `https://<your-domain>/account` to the redirect URLs. Sign-in links, confirmations and password resets land there.
3. In **Authentication → Providers → Email**, keep email confirmation on, set the minimum password length to 8 and turn on leaked-password protection.
4. Set `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `FREE_LIMIT_SECRET` on the server.

The browser gets only the anon key (from `GET /api/config`) and uses it just to sign in. Every read and write of profiles, saved charts and free-tier usage goes through this server with the service-role key, which checks the plan; row-level security blocks direct writes. Plans are set in `profiles.plan` (`free` or `paid`); Stripe will update it in the next phase.

Routes: `GET /api/me`, `PUT /api/charts/:slot` (paid, slots 1–2), `DELETE /api/charts/:slot`. Paid accounts skip the free daily chart limit.

## Paid chart features

Paid accounts (and the preview) get, on every chart: a **chart guide** side panel where each placement, centre, house or graha has *Explain →* and each section has an overview; a four-part **reading** of the chart against today's sky; and **chat** about the chart. Routes: `POST /api/chart-explain` `{chart, tab, item | "overview"}`, `POST /api/chart-reading` `{chart, section, technical}`, `POST /api/chart-chat` `{chart, history}`. The server recalculates the chart from the birth details and builds each prompt from that one item's or section's data (the same prompts as the standalone pages), so no reading sees another. Identical prompts within an hour reuse the answer.

The browser keeps the latest reading, the chart on screen, chats and explanations in session storage for the tab, so leaving a page or refreshing doesn't lose them.

## Payments (Stripe)

The paid plan is $20/month or $180/year; extra linked questions are $5 each. Stripe handles checkout, card details, renewals and cancellations; the webhook is the only thing that turns the paid plan on or off.

1. Run `supabase/migrations/0003_billing.sql`.
2. With a **test** key first: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... PUBLIC_URL=https://your-site npm run stripe:setup`. It creates the products and prices (lookup keys `divinatey_monthly`, `divinatey_yearly`, `divinatey_extra_question`), a billing portal (switch monthly/yearly, update card, cancel at period end, invoices) and the webhook endpoint, and prints `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. It's safe to run again.
3. Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `PUBLIC_URL` on the server. Try a test card (4242 4242 4242 4242) end to end.
4. To launch: run the setup again with the live key, set the live key and live webhook secret, and set `PAID_PREVIEW=0`.

Routes: `POST /api/billing/checkout` `{kind: monthly | yearly | extra, returnPath}`, `POST /api/billing/portal`, `POST /api/stripe/webhook` (signature-checked, each event applied once). The plan stays on while Stripe retries a failed renewal (`past_due`) and turns off when the subscription ends. Over the weekly 5 linked questions, a purchased extra question is used, and charged only once the answer is ready.

## Linking charts to the divination chat (paid)

Under a reading, paid accounts (and the preview) have a **Bring in my charts** button. It opens a side panel where they choose charts; the panel asks only for what the ticked charts need, pre-filled from the chart on screen or a saved chart, and shows coordinates only when Natal or Vedic is ticked. From then on each message is answered in four steps on the server:

1. **Retrieve**: the linked charts are recalculated from the birth details and turned into short fact cards (placements plus today's transits); a fast model picks the 3–6 that bear on the message.
2. **Make sense**: private notes on how the draw and those facts fit together.
3. **Insight**: the reply, in plain words, with at most one explained term.
4. **Polish**: a fast model edits for clarity, jargon and length.

The fast-model steps are optional: if the key can't use the fast model it falls back to the main one; if picking facts fails, a default set is used (core placements plus current transits); if polishing fails or time runs short, the draft is sent. Step timings are logged as `Linked chat steps (ms)`.

Changing the linked charts (adding, removing, editing or unlinking) re-answers the latest question with the new set, marked "↻ updated with your charts". The reply shows a light *drew on* line in plain words, e.g. "how you make decisions (Human Design)". Only chart data goes in, never text from an earlier reading. Each draw asked with linked charts uses one of the week's `LINKED_QUESTIONS_PER_WEEK` (5) questions; follow-ups on the same draw are free, and the preview is unlimited. Run `supabase/migrations/0002_linked_questions.sql` for the weekly count.

## Paid preview

Until payments are switched on, every paid feature is open to everyone under `/preview` (for example `/preview/natal`): no daily chart limit, chat with the oracle without an account, and saving charts when signed in. The main site stays on the free tier. The app sends an `X-Paid-Preview: 1` header from `/preview` pages and the server honours it while `PAID_PREVIEW` isn't `0`. Preview chat has its own per-IP limit (`PREVIEW_CHAT_PER_10MIN`, 20). If accounts are on, add `https://<your-domain>/preview/account` to Supabase's redirect URLs too.

Set `PAID_PREVIEW=0` to close the preview once Stripe is live.

## Standalone chart pages

`npm run astro:pages` writes each chart system as a single offline HTML file to `astro-pages/` (and claude.ai artifact versions to `astro-pages/artifact/`). `scripts/astro/build-cities.mjs` regenerates the place list.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Unit tests cover the casting engine. Server tests run the real server against a mock Anthropic API.
